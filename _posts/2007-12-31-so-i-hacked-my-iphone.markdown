![iphone.gif](http://www.olliekav.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/iphone.gif)Last night, I couldn't wait for the SDK in he end. As soon as its released I'll roll back the phone ;-) Its so good. I spent most of last night downloading apps and testing them out. I'm worried I won't be able to put it down now!I still don't understand why Apple didn't release it with the apps already installed or 3g, guess its one of those things we'll never understand. Now they just need to get the SDK out asap and we can all go back to feeling better about using something that dosn't break the warranty.All about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom on the way down to Brighton ;-)
