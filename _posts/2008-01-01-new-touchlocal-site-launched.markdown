[![TouchLocal](http://www.olliekav.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/touchlocal.gif)](http://www.olliekav.co.uk/blog/2008/01/01/new-touchlocal-site-launched/touchlocal/ "TouchLocal") After a few months of hard work we launched the beta version of the new [TouchLocal](http://www.touchlocal.com "TouchLocal"), this has been a collaborative venture with ourlselves and RedBee media. The design was co-done and the whole build done in house. I'm really proud of this, probably the biggest design/build I've worked on.We have a lot of initial fixes to make but its going really well and lots off really good bits coming in the next few months.
