I had an interesting moment at christmas. We have been working like crazy on our new web project ([touchlocal.com](http://www.touchlocal.com)) to get it live, as part of this I had been covering some basics of accessibility but it had not really been an area we had touched on properly because of the time restraints. So in a moment of madness (or greatness I guess) I fired up my Nan's old school PC with an even older version if IE6 and all the accessibility settings pretty high as they could go so she could view it. I held my breath, worried...To be honest it wasn't terrible, but it failed on quite a few levels. So the Mac got instantly fired up and I worked through quite a few of these issues. It really made me realise just how important they are in the development of a website, especially one we want going to a huge audience. Every person has to be accounted for so they have a pleasant time viewing our site. As developers and designers we have a responsibilty for this, this really resonated true this morning when I read this [456 Berea Street](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200712/accessibility_is_part_of_your_job/) which followed on from this article by James Edwards [Why Accessibility? Because It's Our Job!](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/10/16/why-accessibility-because-its-our-job/). I think this quote really sums it up..._"If we call ourselves professionals, we owe it to our clients, their clients, and ourselves, to do our job properly. A chef must care about health, a builder must care about safety, and we must care about accessibility."_
