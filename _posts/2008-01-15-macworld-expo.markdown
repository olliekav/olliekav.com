I think I am turning into a geek, I can't wait for the keynote speech. Reading some interesting ideas on the design for the new thin laptop (supposedly called MacBook Air). One from [Wired](http://blog.wired.com) suggests this [click here](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/01/breaking-macboo.html). This looks so cool, especially for travelling and DJ'ing work. With my trip to Miami coming up I have a feeling I may be coming home with one of these!
