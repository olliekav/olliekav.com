Well, suprised, slightly dissapointed and wondering what they will release over the coming months is my sum up. From the constant rumours that were circulating around I was expecting the 3g Iphone, a small (say 10"/11" laptop) plus the thin notebook. I suppose one out of three isn't bad, and the MacBook Air is a very lovely bit of kit. I personally won't be buying one, well not in the near future, my MacBook Pro is great, a small laptop would have been perfect for travelling and DJ'ing, I have a feeling the Air wouldn't stand up to much bashing about.I'm actually glad the 3g Iphone did not appear yet as I only purchased mine recently! I can't get over how god it looks though.
