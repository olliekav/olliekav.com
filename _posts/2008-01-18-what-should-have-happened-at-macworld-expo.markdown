Our friends over at MacRumors have supposedly obtained a draft version of the keynote transcripts for the upcoming MacWorld 2008. I have no idea if it is real or not, but I wouldn't doubt it. Here's a summary of the speculated things to come. Here's a compiled list of what MacRumor's two transcripts consist of.
