![orlando_1.gif](http://www.olliekav.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/orlando_1.gif)  So, I have just spent two days in Orlando as part of our Miami trip, dashing around the rides at Disney World and Universal Studios, just as I am leaving to get the bus back to Miami the sky turned and nasty shade of grey and the heavens opened for about 30min followed by a huge thunderstorm, picture attached.
