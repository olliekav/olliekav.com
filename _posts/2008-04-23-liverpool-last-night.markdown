Horrendous, basically. We totally deserved the win! Agreed Chelsea outplayed us in the first 15min but we controlled the game after that. It's been the story of our season not finishing teams off and we should have scored 3 just to put a nail in the coffin last night. 

I suppose on thing to take out of this is we now have to get a result at Chelsea, going there 1-0 up we would have just sat back, absorbed the pressure and it would have been a dull game. Now our whole season resides on this match, bring it on

I think I will have a heart attack watching it though after last night!
