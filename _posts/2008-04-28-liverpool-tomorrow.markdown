Our whole season resides on this game, I'm not sure I'll be able to sit through the match. Any football fan's out there, what's your thinking on the match. Chelsea have been so poor this season but really lucky. We need to come out all gun's blazing tomorrow!

Torres and Gerrard I think could be the key.

Man Utd vs. Barcelona should be a cracking game as well, especially after there recent results
