![Anfield - Liverpool](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/anfield.gif "anfield")
No silverware to show, completely focused on the Champion's League again. I don't know about you but I have had enough of Benitez now. Taking Torres out of the match last night was the final straw for me, "I know, let's remove our star striker in the most important match of the season when were only a goal behind!", yeah genius.

We have not won the league for years, yet still he focuses on the champion's league and forces us to play boring, 1-0 then sit back and defend football. I could see Gerrard leaving in the near future if we don't start bringing in the players to really push for the league, then we'll really be in trouble after all he practically saves us single handedly in most games.

Pissed off, a true Liverpool fan
