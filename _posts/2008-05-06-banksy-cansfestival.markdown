I headed down to this yesterday with my girlfriend, we had planned to do a joint stencil but I pulled out due to nerves, I am not great doing my art in front of people! (and very glad I did to now). Expecting the worst que'ing wise as my housemate had been down the night before and there were 2 hour que's to get in, luckily when we arrived it was only about an hour. 

It was great to see such a range of people down there for what is essentially a graffiti exhibition, show's what an impact Banksy and other street artists have had on out culture that many people who would normally frown upon graffiti and street art came out for this festival, especially with the political overtones and lot of the pieces had. I was almost waiting for Gordon Brown to turn up but guessed that may have been a bit much. The prime minister supporting street art, whatever next!

The best part of the entire day was my girlfriend's stencil piece, due to turning up on the last day there was not much room left to paint, and due to her piece being quite large the guy gave her a spot right on a Banksy piece, with a huge crowd surrounding it. I think this was my worst nightmare, not only getting it right but doing it in front of a large crowd. Anyway I think it came out great, she did an amazing job considering the pressure and should get a lot of exposure due to its placement.
