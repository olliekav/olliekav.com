So a friend has asked me to create a graffiti canvas for his house, and my thinking was I would chronicle my process from start to finish so you could see it all. I am still undecided whether it will be a scan into illustrator and traced then finished in photoshop or sprayed straight on, maybe I'll do both, we shall see!


### Step 1

Anyway on with with the initial sketching out, just getting an idea of how the letter forms will work together, more to follow over the weekend....

So now I have got my basic letterforms I want to expand on this and create a mirror image, a basic reflection of my original image plus expand on my basic sketch with some new elements and a wrapper. With this I wanted the effect of falling drops (I think they'll be fire), so I started to add new effects and the shadowing, just to see how it all fits together. This will give me the main base for the next step of colours.

Cool, so I'm happy with that, next step are the colours and a decision on scanning or going straight onto canvas. Update to come soon ....
