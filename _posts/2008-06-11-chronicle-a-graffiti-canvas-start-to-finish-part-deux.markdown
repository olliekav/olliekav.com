Well after being completely caught up with work commitments and other freelance work I was not able to get my head into this to finish but finally managed to free up some spare time over the past few days, so instead of adding it to my other post I thought it would be better to create a new post to chronicle the final steps to creation...  

After playing around with my initial sketches again I was finally happy with the outline and I scanned it into illustrator...

I started with the full shadow outline and moved inwards...

I had the base outline and shadowing, now on with the colours, the piece spells out "Gaff", basically slang for house (this is what my friends asked for as its going in their flat) so I wanted to get across the impression of the words being the actual house, warm and comforting, and the outside world being a bit more cold and depressing.

To continue this theme I went for clouds surrounding the words and raining around it whilst the words and warm in their orange glow, these rain drops would then create puddles and splashes on the ground. Then I added a parched background to give it a bit more organic feel.

There you have it, the final piece, which will go on a 50" x 40" canvas in their lounge. This has got me itching to do some canvases for our house now as I just have not had the free time to do it recently, and I really miss it......
