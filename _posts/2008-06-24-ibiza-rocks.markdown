![Ibiza Sunset](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ibiza-sunset.gif "ibiza-sunset")Well I returned from a week in Ibiza on Saturday morning and I have still not recovered but what a week! I love that place, it's like a clubber's paradise if your into house music as all the top DJ's flock over for the summer for their residencies in the best club's on the planet. We were really lucky when we arrived as our first hotel was flooded so we got moved to a beachside hotel with a great swimming pool..... what a touch! <!--more-->The rest of the holiday is a bit of a blur but so much fun, we went to [We Love Space](http://www.welove-music.com/) on the Sunday night which was awesome, Paul Woolford, Felix da Housecat and 2ManyDJ's rocked it and I came away with a massive smile on my face (probably down to the amount of beer drunk!).![We love Space](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/space.jpg "space")On the Monday after getting ridiculously burnt and sleeping a lot we decided on [Cocoon](http://www.cocoon.net/) at [Amnesia](http://www.amnesia-ibiza.com/) and this was the night I was really looking forward to!! Sven Vath and Ricardo Villalobos on the same bill is never gonna dissapoint and this didn't, sound system was firing and we didn't stop dancing till we left at 6am, such an amazing night and just wish it could have gone on longer!!.![Cocoon at Amnesia](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/amnesia.jpg "amnesia")By this point by sunburn had got so bad it was proving a struggle to wear a t-shirt so the clubbing was put on hold for a couple of night's and we hit the bar's (yet still managed to be out till 6am!). The last club night we hit was Monza at [Club Privilege](http://www.privilegeibiza.com/) which definately lives up to its billing as the largest club in the world, it is massive. Had a great night here rocking out to M.A.N.D.Y, Monoblock LIVE, Dorian Paic &amp; Vera. A great way to finish of a fantastic holiday catching up with my best mates.![cocoon at amnesia pic2](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/amnesia2.jpg "amnesia2")To sum it up I spent a small fortune, got stupidly sunburnt, sleep a lot, sat on the beech a lot and rocked out at some of the best club's I have ever been to some of the world's best DJ's, sounds like the perfect holiday to me, though I am struggling to recover this week! Luckily I am of to Canada at the weekend with my G/F which is the perfect antidote!Closing parties anyone......?More photos are available on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/olliekav/) or on my facebook account if your friends with me...There are also some photo galleries up on [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/photo-gallery.aspx?set=4070)
