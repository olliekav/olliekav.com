![Olliekav - Logo 080708](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/graff-logo0080708.jpg "graff-logo0080708")I have uploaded a new logo to the site, this is in no way the final polished article, far from it in fact. <!--more--> To push myself into sketching each week and tearing myself away from the computer I have decided to take a Google like approach to my new logo and run through as many iterations as possible until I finally come to something I am finally happy with. This also has a knock on effect as I will be using my final logo design for a tattoo once I pluck up the courage, this means I want to be perfectly happy with the final design so I will take as long as I need to get it right!  
I want to strike a balance with the logo of all the design styles that interest me, starting with a very simple graffiti approach and moving this into a more typography based approach with graffiti elements, let's see how it turns out.

I'll be uploading a new logo every Saturday (well every week depending on the calendar) and we'll see how long it takes for me to get to the finished article!
