![New Site Features](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/new-features.jpg "new-features")I have had a busy couple of days getting some new bits ready for this site and learning a lot in the process. The main bulk of work has gone into getting the site Iphone compatible, choosing to keep this to just the blog at the moment I will open up the other areas once I can get the loading times down concerning the images. I have added a bunch of resources at the bottom of this post that I used. <!--more-->
I want to do a lot more work on this as it is something that really interests me, there are a lot of small features I want to add to the Iphone version of this site, but I made a decision to release the first one otherwise I would never get it up and now I can focus on making it even better. I am also working on designs for a native Iphone application at the moment which is super exciting. So now if you point your Iphone to [olliekav.com](http://www.olliekav.com) you'll get a nive fresh Iphone view.

The next feature I have added is the Brightkite plugin for Wordpress. I have altered this slightly to be more compatible with my site and I'd like to move away from a static map to a dynamic one once I have more time to play with it. [You can get the plugin from here](http://blog.brightkite.com/2008/06/02/new-blog-widgets-plugins/). I am leaning more and more away from Twitter to [Brightkite](http://www.brightkite.com) as I love the location based networking it involves and I can see the API bringing a real benefit to apps.

As a last feature I have added my weekly logo, a homage to one of my favourite logos by one of my favourite design houses [Inocuo Design](http://www.inocuodesign.com/portfolio/).

Just as a disclaimer a lot of changes I made have affected IE6 in some areas, while I made sure the whole site was IE6 compatible when I first built it I am now using the progressive enhancement approach as I will with all my sites and some features won't be available for IE6 users.
