![nike sb limited edition](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nike-sb.jpg "nike-sb")Some of you may know but most won't that I am a complete trainer freak! I have been collecting trainers since I was 18, originally starting when I was playing a lot of basketball... <!--more-->![Ollie K shoe collection](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/shoe-collection1.jpg "shoe-collection")What makes trainer hunting even more difficult is the fact I have Size UK13 feet, so I can't exactly stroll into the closest store and pick up any styles I want! This kinda leaves me with trips to the states to pick up any new styles of hunting around on eBay or the web for the freshest styles. I was lucky enough last week to pick up the Nike SB Low - Gibson Guitar case Limited edition which I have been after for a while. Very similar to the Gibson Guitar case the kicks feature a brown exterior in premium brown leather and a pink fur interior.One particular style I have been after for ages is the Nike P-Rods which seem impossible to get in anything over a UK12, if anyone knows the whereabouts of these let me know immediately!
P.S. Trainer heads have proabably seen these floating about recently but they are going for stupid money on eBay at the moment [Hyperdunk Marty McFly](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Nike-HYPERDUNK-Supreme-Air-MCFLY-Kobe-2015-PE-MVP-14_W0QQitemZ280246605803QQcmdZViewItem?hash=item280246605803&_trksid=p3286.m14.l1308). Back to the Future inspired Nike's, I really want them but can't justify spending that on a pair of shoes!
