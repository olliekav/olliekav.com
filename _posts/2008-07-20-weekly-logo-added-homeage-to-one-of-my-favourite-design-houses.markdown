![new-logo-180708](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/new-logo-180708.jpg "new-logo-180708")So for my new logo this week I decided to do something a little different and pay homage to one of my favourite design houses who have their roots in street based graffiti design. <!--more-->
[Inocuo Design](http://www.inocuodesign.com/portfolio/) was founded in 2002 and I have always followed there work as it has inspired me a lot. 

"Inocuo was a well known graffiti nick name written on many of the walls around the city of Barcelona as a signature for certain scriptures that became very popular during the 90â€™s decade" and I think this is really reflected in there work. Have a look through the portfolio as I'm sure you'll be impressed, and enjoy the logo inspired by these guys for the next week.

edit: I have now changed the logo but here it is in in all its glory...
