![Liverpool FC logo](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/liverpool.gif "liverpool")Well I wouldn't say it's been a great start to the season, but them again we have not lost, which is always a good sign when you are playing badly and still winning. I still think the team is lacking in certain areas even though we seem to have what is considered a very rounded squad. The team has been playing with no width in the first three games, everything going through the central areas and for this reason we have looked very static. There is no support for the front two and Keane has not looked like he was even playing.<!--more-->
I am glad the Barry saga seems to now be over, I really don't think he is an Â£18m pound and although he is good is not exactly going to set the team alight. I have always felt we needed a player in a similar vein to Deco to take the weight of Gerrard and he could sit in the gap behind the front two. Someone with a great footballing brain to control the game and set that killer ball to release the front two. Kuyt is not a winger for me and although a workhorse could easily be replaced with someone with pace and skill to run at defenders, Babel is still not the finished article and even purchasing Albert Riera (who was shocking at Manchester City) doesn't give us enough solid options out wide.

Mascherano being back from the world cup is a great help now that Gerrard is out for 2 weeks and hopefully Alonso (so glad he did not leave) steps his game up playing like he was in the European championship to tide us over a difficult period without the captain. A win at Aston Villa on Sunday will be our best start to the season since 1994 and should put us in good position going into the second month. Now all we need is to start playing great attacking football and Torres and Keane to start forming a formidable partnership and I could see us doing well.

Will we win the league this year? I don't think so but we should go closer than last season if everyone keeps fit playing to the top of their ability.
