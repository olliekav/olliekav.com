![Design feature in web designer magazine](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/magazine-feature.gif "magazine-feature")Well what a surprise this was! I was sent a tweet from [Ash Loudon](http://twitter.com/Ash_Loudon) saying I was featured in the latest [Web Designer Magazine](http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/). So I dragged my hungover self down to WH Smiths on Saturday morning not sure what to expect.<!--more--> Flicked through the magazine expecting to be near the back somewhere tucked away, couldn't find anything, went back to the start and found a full page feature on my site on page 10 with the best of the month. I then proceeded to walk around the rest of the day with a cheesy grin on my face! 
Feels really nice to get the recognition after all the hard work I have put in this past year. Thanks [Web Designer Magazine](http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/)!
. If you want to check it out pick up issue 154 and flick to page 10.
