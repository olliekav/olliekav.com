Just a little update on some the recent bits I have been up to. Never really seem to get the time to update this blog anymore! <!--more-->
I have been working with the guys over at [Zoopy.com](http://zoopy.com) in South Africa on some of there video campaigns. One for the [Framed](http://zoopy.com/framed) campaign and one for the Presidential campaigns you can see below.

The Framed campaign was a great collaborative design to work on.The logo was done by [www.cowafrica.com/](http://www.cowafrica.com/) then passed to me to do the page layout and design using the logo style and branding.
It was then passed back to [www.cowafrica.com/](http://www.cowafrica.com/) to add some more characters and illustrative elements before I tied the design together, completed the XHTML/CSS and passed it back to the dev team at [www.zoopy.com](http://www.zoopy.com) to work there magic.Can be viewed at [www.zoopy.com/framed](http://www.zoopy.com/framed)![Change One Thing - Zoopy](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/cot-zoopy-final.gif "Change One Thing - Zoopy")
Also the final updates for the [TouchLocal Beta Site](http://beta.touchlocal.com) have been done and uploaded. It is still in very new Beta state so some areas may not work quite perfectly, but it is the first large scale Flex project I have work on, along with doing the design/HTML/CSS and some JQuery goodness along with the dev guys at touchlocal.
