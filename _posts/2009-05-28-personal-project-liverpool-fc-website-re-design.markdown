Seeing as spend an enourmous amount of time on this site I thought I would have a quick blast at re-designing the Liverpool Football Club Homepage. <!--more-->[![Liverpool FC website](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/liverpoolfc-one.jpg "liverpoolfc")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/olliekav/3546470787/sizes/o/ "Liverpool FC Re-Design - View larger Image")**[View Larger Image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/olliekav/3546470787/sizes/o/ "View larger image")**The current site feels out of date and crowded . This is not perfect by any means but gives a lot more room to the content and lets it breath. Also re-structured the grid layout to give a more cohesive flow to the content. Really wanted to focus on the content first and let the design flow around it. I also really wanted to avoid the cliched Premiership Football club designs as they all feel very generic and basically the same!
It would be great to hear any comments!! ;)
