Being heavily influenced by [Tim Van Damme's](http://timvandamme.com/) personal links site I wanted to try something similiar, but with a much heavier focus on Graphic Design. After having a chat with [Mike](http://www.http://thethingswemake.co.uk/.com) at [Carsonfied](http://carsonified.com/) on the Carsonified tour we were both in agreement that Graphic Design is almost becoming like the forgotten artform on the web, and we really need to go back to pushing the boundaries of what is possible. <!--more-->I started of with a [Flash version](http://www.oliverkavanagh.com/v2), but I wasn't really happy with this and wanted to push the typography aspect a lot more and came up with the design below. I have a limited time frame to work on this and there are improvements that can be made such as the scroll bars and containing the content within the browser window on re-size but it will be a continuous experimentation and will keep changing and evolving as and when I get time. I definitely did not want to be contained by typical web design!![oliverkavanagh.com screenshot](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/oliver-kavanagh-large.jpg "oliver-kavanagh-large")**[View the completed design](http://www.oliverkavanagh.com)**
