I was asked by [http://www.kevincoleman.ie/](http://www.kevincoleman.ie/) if I would be interested in designing a football based blog based around articles, opinions and news. I jumped at the chance to get involved and came up with the design below. <!--more--> I wanted the design to be primarily focused on the content and imagery and not let it distract from this.  A newspaper style column based design seemed to be the way to go with minimal colour (in fact kept to a palette of three main colours) and I'm pleased how it turned out. I built the final design into wordpress. Let me know what you think! ![backpagefootball.com](http://www.olliekav.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/backpage-large.jpg "backpagefootball.com")**[View the live site - http://backpagefootball.com](http://backpagefootball.com)**
