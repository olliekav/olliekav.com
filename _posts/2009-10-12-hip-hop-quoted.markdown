I listen to so much Hip-Hop, and I have been dying to do an art directed site being heavily influenced by [Gregory Wood](http://gregorywood.co.uk) and [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com). It seemed like a natural step to create a blog based on hip-hop quotes and have each quote art directed. This gives me a chance to flex some print/magazine design in a web environment. Some might work, some not but it is meant to be an experiment in what is possible.
