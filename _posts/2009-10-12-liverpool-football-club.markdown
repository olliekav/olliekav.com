The current site feels out of date and crowded . This is not perfect by any means but gives a lot more room to the content and lets it breath. Also re-structured the grid layout to give a more cohesive flow to the content. Really wanted to focus on the content first and let the design flow around it. I also really wanted to avoid the cliched Premiership Football club designs as they all feel very generic and basically the same!
