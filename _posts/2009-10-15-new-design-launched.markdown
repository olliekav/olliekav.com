Why you may ask? Well as much as I loved my previous blog design I have much more experience using Wordpress since I built that and it had become unmanageable to update. Instead of using pages for my portfolio and having to upload new items via ftp each time I wanted to be able to post portfolio items into a portfolio category, and the same thing with my DJ mixes. 

I used different post and category templates to get different layouts for the design and much more of a focus on the baseline grid and layout structure. The minimal design means I can add new features easily just building on the new base I have. It also means using the great [Designate plugin](http://github.com/ionfish/designate) I will be able to art direct my posts very much in the vain of [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com) as this is something I have wanted to do for ages!

Anyway I hope you enjoy the new design, let me know if you find anything buggy, and I will write some more posts about some of the design decisions chosen.
