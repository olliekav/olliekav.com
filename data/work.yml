I led the Design & Development on this project with an extensive knowledge of wordpress to create a full faceted search with custom fields that could be easily customised and extended. The design had to be flexible enough to support both the Green & Red Chambers but all contained within one Wordpress install for easily switching between Senators & MPS."
