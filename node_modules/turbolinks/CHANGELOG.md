## Turbolinks (master)

## Turbolinks 2.5.3 (December 8, 2013)

*   Prevent the progress bar from filling the entire screen in older versions of Safari.

    *Adam Becker*, *Javan Makhmali*

## Turbolinks 2.5.2 (November 10, 2014)

*   Use document.documentElement.cloneNode() when parsing new documents to properly handle device pixel ratio calculations.

    *Tom Ward*

*   Reflect the redirected url before actually changing the page, so page-change listeners
    get to see the final URL, rather than the before-redirect URL.

    *DHH*

*   Add an optional progress bar indicator while loading. See README for example and details.
    This will be on by default from Turbolinks 3.0.

	*Javan Makhmali*

*   Avoid double requests when the server returns a cross origin redirect by directly loading the
    redirect location.

    *Hsiaoming Yang*

## Turbolinks 2.4.0 (October 2, 2014)

*   Expose event list via `Turbolinks.EVENTS`.

    *Robert Mosolgo, William Meleyal*

*   Add a `page:before-unload` event, triggered immediately before the page is changed.  The
    event is triggered regardless of where the page came from (server vs cache).

    Note that this event is not canceleable like the similarly named native event `beforeunload`,
    and therefore should not be viewed as counterparts.

    *Nick Reed*

*   If the Prototype library is loaded, additionally trigger events with `Event.fire` so they can be
    observed using Prototype methods like `.on()` and `.observe()`.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Maintain correct load order of scripts in the `body` by explicitly setting `async` to false if it is
    not already set.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Include the target URL in the event data for the `page:before-change` event.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Fix issue where clicking a link with `href="#"` would not be ignored by Turbolinks when the current location
    already ends in an empty anchor.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Handle HTML parsing inconsistencies present in Safari 7.1+.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Only set the request_method cookie after non-GET requests.

    *Matt Brictson*

## Turbolinks 2.3.0 (August 21, 2014)

*   Revert pushState timing behavior to how it was prior to v2.2.0. The URL will not change until the request
    returns from the server and the response is determined to be valid.  This notably fixes the behavior of
    the back button after a Rails error page is loaded.

    Note that any functions bound to `page:fetch` or `page:before-change` can no longer depend on `document.location`
    to determine the URL of the new page.  Instead, use the data bound to the event object (`e.originalEvent.data.url`).

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 2.2.3 (August 19, 2014)

*   Fix HTML5 autofocus for Firefox.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Prevent `url_for` errors when using _unsupported_ Ruby 1.8.  Note that `link_to :back` and
    `redirect_to :back` will not function properly when using Turbolinks with Ruby 1.8.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Fix handling of anchors/hashes with respect to navigating the browser history.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Add support for Rails 4.2.

    *Aaron Patterson*

## Turbolinks 2.2.2 (April 6, 2014)

*   Always use absolute URLs as cache keys and in state objects.  Eliminates possibility of multiple
    cache objects for the same page.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Allow periods in a link's query string (ex. `/users?sort=account.email`) without it interfering with
    the extension check.

    *Kuba KuÅºma*

*   Don't process links with no `href` attribute.

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 2.2.1 (January 30, 2014)

*   Do not store redirect_to location in session if the request did not come from Turbolinks.  Fixes
    rare bug that manifests when directing items like image tag sources through ActionController and
    subsequently redirecting those requests to a different origin. This would cause the session variable
    to be set but never deleted (since the redirect request was external), resulting in the next request
    being declared a redirect no matter what.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Extend handling of Firefox [history.state bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=949471)
    through Firefox 27.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Fix handling of `:back` option in ActionView helpers `url_for` and `link_to`.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Delay binding of history change handler long enough to bypass the popstate event that some
    browsers fire on the initial page load.  Prevents duplicate requests in certain scenarios when
    traversing the browser history.

    *Anton Pawlik + Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 2.2.0 (January 10, 2014)

*   Add transition cache feature. When enabled, cached copies of pages will be shown
    before fetching and displaying a new copy from the server. A individual page can be opted-out
    by adding `data-no-transition-cache` to any DOM element on the page.

    *Matt De Leon*

## Turbolinks 2.1.0 (December 17, 2013)

*   Improve browser support for `noscript` tag removal.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Add a `page:expire` event for garbage collecting purposes.  Triggered when a page is deleted
    from the cache due to reaching the cache size limit.  Pass the cached page object in with the
    event data.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Allow configuration for additional link extensions to be processed by Turbolinks beyond `.html`.

    ```coffeescript
    Turbolinks.allowLinkExtensions()                # => ['html']
    Turbolinks.allowLinkExtensions 'md'             # => ['html', 'md']
    Turbolinks.allowLinkExtensions 'coffee', 'scss' # => ['html', 'md', 'coffee', 'scss']
    ```

    *Nick Reed*

*   Handle [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=949471) in Firefox 26 where the initial
    value of history.state is undefined instead of null, which led to Turbolinks not being initialized.

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 2.0.0 (December 4, 2013) ##

*   Trigger page:update on page:change as well as jQuery's ajaxSuccess, if jQuery is available.
    This allows you to bind listeners to both full page changes and partial ajax updates.
    If you're not using jQuery, you can trigger page:update yourself on XMLHttpRequest to
    achieve the same result.

    *DHH*

*   Trigger page:change on DOMContentLoaded so you can bind initializers that need to be run
    either on initial or subsequent page loads. This might be backwards incompatible, so we
    are also bumping the major version.

    *DHH*

*   Expire `request_method` cookie after reading it.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Trigger events on DOMContentLoaded and jQuery's ajaxSuccess regardless of whether Turbolinks
    is initialized or not.

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 1.3.1 (November 14, 2013) ##

*   Accommodate for bug in Chrome 31+ that causes `assetsChanged` to always return true. (#278)

    *Andrew Volozhanin + Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 1.3.0 (July 11, 2013) ##

*   Change URL *after* fetching page.

    *Marek Labos*

*   Fix compatibility with `link_to :back`.

    *Marek Labos*

*   Send correct referer after asset change detected.

    *Marek Labos*

*   Add the `page:before-change` event, triggered when a Turbolinks-enabled link is clicked.
    Can be used to cancel the Turbolinks process.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Add Turbolinks.pagesCached() to the public API for getting and setting the size of the page cache.

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 1.2.0 (June 2, 2013) ##

*   Handle 5xx responses

    *Marek Labos*

*   Add the ability to not execute scripts on turbolinks page loads by
    specifying `data-turbolinks-eval=false` on the `<script>` tag. For example:
    `<script type="text/javascript" data-turbolinks-eval=false>`

    *Mario Visic*

*   Workaround for WebKit history state [bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93506)
    with regards to the handling of 4xx responses.

    *Yasuharu Ozaki*

*   Extracted `fetchReplacement()` onload response-handling logic out into `validateResponse()`.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Changed response header name from `X-XHR-Current-Location` to `X-XHR-Redirected-To`.  The
    header will only be sent if there has been a redirect.  Fixes compatibility issue when
    using `redirect_to` with options such as anchors or a trailing slash by storing the redirect
    location in a session variable and then using that value to set the response header.

    *Yasuharu Ozaki*

*   Escape URLs when checking for cross-origin redirects.

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 1.1.1 (April 3, 2013) ##

*   Improve performance of `constrainPageCacheTo`, `executeScriptTags`, and `removeNoscriptTags`
    by not gathering and returning the results of the loop comprehensions.

    *Tim Ruffles*

*   Change page without Turbolinks when Turbolinks.visit is called in Chrome on iOS

    *Frank Showalter*

*   Maintain the latest CSRF authenticity token in the `<meta name="csrf-token">` head tag, if it
    exists.

    *Nick Reed*

## Turbolinks 1.1.0 (March 24, 2013) ##

*   Added Turbolinks::XDomainBlocker module with after_filter to detect cross-domain
    redirects, returning 403 Forbidden so that the client will reissue the request
    without Turbolinks. (XSS Protection)

    *Mala*

*   Remove hash when checking for non-HTML links. (XSS Protection)

    *Nick Reed + Mala*

*   Check Content-Type response header.  Fall back to non-Turbolinks request unless the
    header is either `text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`, or `application/xml`. (XSS Protection)

    *Nick Reed + Mala*

*   Add a `page:receive` event, triggered the moment the ajax request returns, before any
    processing is done.

    *Ben Weintraub*

*   Explicitly set `useCapture` flag to default (false) on addEventListener and
    removeEventListener calls. Removes errors on older browsers where the flag
    was required.

    *Matthieu Aussaguel*

*   Copy `<noscript>` tag list by slicing so that `removeNoscriptTags` works with
    multiple `<noscript>` tags.

    *Lion Vollnhals**

*   Copy `<script>` tag list by slicing so that `executeScriptTags` works in situations
    where a script removes itself from the DOM.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Add link to Turbolinks Compatibility project to README.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Reflect X-XHR-Referer in `request.referer`

    *Nick Reed*

    browsers.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Add jquery.turbolinks note to README

*   Disable Turbolinks on Chrome for iOS

    *David Estes*

*   Disable Turbolinks after non-GET requests.  Adds a cookie named `request_method`.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Abort XHR request if the user clicks another link before it finishes.

    *David Estes*

*   Fall back to using `document.location.href = url` when there is an error so the
    applicationCache can be used in offline mode.

    *R. Potter*

*   Remove hash from XHR url to fix IE 10 bug.

    *Nick Reed*

*   Scroll to anchor link id if link has an anchor tag.

    *Yasuharu Ozaki*

*   Allow Turbolinks to function in non-Rails environments.

    *Yasuharu Ozaki*

*   Optimize script tag execution by using script injection instead of `window.eval`.
    Deprecates the use of the `data-turbolinks-evaluated` attribute.

    *Nick Reed + John-David Dalton*

    *Nick Reed*

*   Add note to README about dynamically added scripts

    *Manuel Meurer*

## Turbolinks 0.5.2 (November 26, 2012) ##

*   Prevent issue with ActionController::Live by moving `set_xhr_current_location`
    from an an after_filter to a before_filter.

    *Kentaro Kuribayashi*

*   Only execute script tags on XHR request load, not from history fetch.

    *David Estes*

    assets have changed.

    *Yasuharu Ozaki*

*   Remove the `samePageLink` method.

    *Yasuharu Ozaki*
