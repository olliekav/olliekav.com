If a translation file for your language does not come bundled with this plugin, then check out this URL:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress

It will walk you through how to translate the plugin using the provided template file, "kimili_flash_embed.pot".

Once you're done and have the plugin translated, please send me your translation file so that I can
bundle it with my plugin: michael@kimili.com

I will give you credit and it will help others who speak your language.

Thanks!
